# OOP-Team-Profile-Generator
            
## Description
    
This project is my second dive into back-end development, and this application was a little more challenging. This application uses Node.js to generate an HTML file with content based on user input via promts in the terminal. The main feature of this application to be showcased, however, is the test feature using jest. I hope this detailed README will help anyone else who is just starting back-end development, or a similar project, get started on their way.

## Visuals

Here are some simple visuals of what the process should look like after you have finished the prompts and what your finished HTML page will look like.
    
## Installation
    
To use this application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your desktop with inquirer and jest as dependencies. Once in your code editor of choice, you will need to open your terminal and initialize npm with the command: npm init. Once you have npm initialized, you will install npm with the command: npm install. To install inquirer, you will use the command: npm install inquirer@8.2.4, or whichever is the most recent version. You should then add an object called "devDependencies" into your package.json below the original "dependencies" object to allow jest. You will need to create a folder full of test js scripts, and I recommend that you follow a similar folder structure to what I currently have. That is all that you need to do in order to use this Team profile generator. I attempted to include as much style in the HTML file as I could, however to add your own style and perfect the look of the deployed site, I recommend adding your own css file. I committed mine with my own, but I recommend you create your own for your personal style.
            
## Usage
    
This project can be used to generate a HTML file with a prompted guideline for an easier experience creating a baseline HTML for a team profile. Once in your terminal you will type the command: node index.js. This command will begin the prompts to build your team profile, and once you have entered your input, you will simply hit enter to continue to the next question until you have finished the prompts. When you reach the prompt to select the type of team member you wish to add, you will need to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to cycle through the choices, not your mouse. Once you have finished the prompts, your README will be created and should appear within your files. If you need to change anything you will be able to change the file as necessary, simply stage, commit, and push your changes once you have finished to solidify your generated HTML. To enhance your own personal touch please add your own style.css!

## Tests
  
There are four different tests that you can use with this application. These tests will test the functions in the individual team member's js script. All you will need to do to run these tests is use the command "npm test".
